      "tips": [
        "<li><strong>- Ideal Times for Safari:</strong> Plan your visit during the dry season from February to July for optimal wildlife sightings. The scarcity of water during this period concentrates animals around existing water sources, increasing your chances of spotting them.</li>",
        "<li><strong>- Morning vs. Afternoon Safaris:</strong> Consider participating in both morning and afternoon safaris. The early hours often present excellent opportunities to witness predators in action, while the afternoon allows you to observe animals as they prepare for the night.</li>"
